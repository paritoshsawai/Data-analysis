# Data-analysis-portfolio
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive sales dashboard that provides valuable insights into the sales performance of a theoretical bicycle retail company. The dashboard will help the executive team understand the company's sales trends, revenue generation, and other key metrics over a three-year period from 2016 to 2018.
The project follows a structured five-step data analytics process:

## Understanding the Problem and Data Extraction:

1. The first step involves understanding the requirements of the executive team and defining the project goals.
2. To gather the necessary data, an SQL query is written to extract a detailed data set from the company's relational database.
3. The data set includes information such as order details, customer information, product details, store locations, and sales representative details.

## Data Transformation in Excel:

1. The SQL-generated data set is imported into Microsoft Excel.
2. Pivot tables and charts are created in Excel to organize and visualize the data.
3. An interactive dashboard is built in Excel, featuring various charts and slicers (filters) to explore the data dynamically.

## Data Visualization in Tableau:

1. The Excel data set is then connected to Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool.
2. In Tableau, a visually appealing and interactive dashboard is created, featuring various chart types, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, tree maps, and maps.
3. The Tableau dashboard is designed to provide a clear and concise overview of the company's sales performance.

## Interactivity and User Experience:

1. Both the Excel and Tableau dashboards are made interactive using features like slicers, filters, and parameters.
2. These interactive elements allow users to explore the data from different perspectives, such as filtering by year, state, store, or other relevant dimensions.
3. The interactivity empowers users to gain insights based on their selections and drill down into specific areas of interest.

## Presentation and Delivery:

1. The final Excel and Tableau dashboards are designed to be visually appealing and easy to understand.
2. The dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of the company's sales performance, including metrics such as total revenue, revenue by region, store, product category, brand, top customers, and sales representatives.
3. The project showcases the end-to-end process of data analytics, from data extraction to visualization and presentation, using tools like SQL, Excel, and Tableau.


Throughout the project, emphasis is placed on creating informative and interactive dashboards that can aid the executive team in making data-driven decisions. The project demonstrates the power of data analytics and the use of various tools to transform raw data into actionable insights.
